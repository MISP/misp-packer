MISP                http://\4{enp0s3}       admin@admin.test / admin
                    https://\4{enp0s3}
MISP-Modules (API)  http://\4{enp0s3}:6666  (Auth Key)

The default system credentials are: misp / Password1234

On VirtualBox port-forwarding from your host to the guest is in place.
Below are the forwards as we need to use ports >1024 for some.

SSH                -> 2222
MISP               -> 8080 and 8443
MISP-Modules (API) -> 1666 (API)

If this fails, make sure the host machine is not occupying one of the forwarded ports or a firewall is active.
