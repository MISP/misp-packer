The default system credentials are: misp / Password1234

On VirtualBox port-forwarding from your host to the guest is in place.
Below are the forwards as we need to use ports >1024 for some.

MISP         -> 8080 and :8443
ssh          -> 2222
misp-modules -> 1666

If this fails, make sure the host machine is not occupying one of the forwarded ports or a firewall is active.
